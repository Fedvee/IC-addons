    "Info": "Q: GFslot3/Freely, W: GFslot3/Gazrick, E: Slot3NotOminNotEmpty/Freely. Addon switches to E if contracts are fulfilled before ultimates are all ready. Addon switches to W while Azaka's ult is active. Specify 0 contracts for Omin. To reduce lag, the addon sleeps for time proportional to the number of contracts remaining. If you use Krull, make sure he is in all three formations.",
